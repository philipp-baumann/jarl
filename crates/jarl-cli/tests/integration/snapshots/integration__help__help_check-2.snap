  -u, --unsafe-fixes                   Include fixes that may not retain the original intent of the  code.
      --fix-only                       Apply fixes to resolve lint violations, but don't report on leftover violations. Implies `--fix`.
      --allow-dirty                    Apply fixes even if the Git branch is not clean, meaning that there are uncommitted files.
      --allow-no-vcs                   Apply fixes even if there is no version control system.

  -m, --min-r-version <MIN_R_VERSION>  The mimimum R version to be used by the linter. Some rules only work starting from a specific version.
      --output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>  Output serialization format for violations. [default: concise] [possible values: concise, github, json]
      --assignment-op <ASSIGNMENT_OP>  Assignment operator to use, can be either `<-` or `=`.
  -h, --help                           Print help (see more with '--help')

      --no-color               Disable colored output. To turn colored output off, either set this option or set the environment variable `NO_COLOR` to any non-zero value
