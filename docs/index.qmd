<div style="text-align: center"><i>Just Another R Linter</i> </div>

<br>

Jarl is a fast linter[^linter-explanation] for R.

* XXX times faster than `lintr` and XXX times faster than `flir`
* automatic fixes when possible
* support for 20+ [`lintr` rules](rules.md) (and growing)
* integration in popular IDEs and editors (VS Code, Positron, Emacs, Vim, ...)
* CLI available
* built-in CI workflow

Jarl is built on [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/), a fast formatter for R written in Rust.

[^linter-explanation]: A code linter is a tool that does static code analysis to search for programming errors, bugs, and suspicious patterns of code.
