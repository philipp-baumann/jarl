# Changelog

## Development

### Features

- New CLI argument `--statistics` to show the number of violations per rule instead
  of the details of each violation. Jarl prints a hint to use this argument when
  more than 15 violations are reported (only when `--output-format` is `concise`
  or `full`). This value can be configured with the environment variable
  `JARL_N_VIOLATIONS_HINT_STAT`. (#250, #266)

- Jarl now looks in parent folders for `jarl.toml`. It searches until the user
  config folder is reached (the location of this folder depends on the OS:
  `~/.config` on Unix and `~/AppData/Roaming` on Windows). Jarl uses the first
  `jarl.toml` that is found. This is useful to store settings that should be
  common to all projects (e.g. `assignment = "<-"`) without creating a
  `jarl.toml`, which is a common situation for standalone R scripts. (#253)

- New rules:
  - `redundant_ifelse` (#260)
  - `unnecessary_nesting` (#268)
  - `unreachable_code` (#261)

- When the output format is `full` or `concise`, rule names now have a hyperlink
  leading to the website documentation (#278).

### Other changes

- The rule `assignment` is now disabled by default (#258).

- The rule `sample_int` is now disabled by default (#262).

### Bug fixes

- When `output-format` is `json` or `github`, additional information displayed in
  the terminal (e.g. timing) isn't included anymore to avoid parsing errors (#254).

- Fixed a bug in the number of "fixable diagnostics" reported when the arg
  `fixable` is present in `jarl.toml` but `--fix` is not passed (#255).

## 0.3.0

### Breaking changes

- Jarl now excludes by default file paths matching the following patterns:
  `.git/`, `renv/`, `revdep/`, `cpp11.R`, `RcppExports.R`, `extendr-wrappers.R`,
  and `import-standalone-*.R`.

  A new CLI argument `--no-default-exclude` can be used to check those files as
  well. This argument overrides the `default-exclude = true` option when set in
  `jarl.toml` (#178, @novica).

### Features

- `--output-format json` now contains two fields `diagnostics` and `errors` (#219).
- Better support for namespaced function calls, both when reporting violations
  and when fixing them (#221).
- The `class_equals` rule now also reports cases like `identical(class(x), "foo")`
  and `identical("foo", class(x))` (#234).
- New rules:
  - `expect_s3_class` (#235)
  - `expect_type` (#226)
  - `fixed_regex` (#227)
  - `sprintf` (#224)
  - `string_boundary` (#225)
  - `vector_logic` (#238)

### Fixes

- `# nolint` comments are now properly applied to nodes that are function arguments, e.g.
  ```r
  foo(
    # nolint
    any(is.na(x))
  )
  ```
  does not report a violation anymore (#229).

### Other changes

- `expect_named` no longer reports cases like `expect_equal(x, names(y))` because
  rewriting those as `expect_named(y, x)` would potentially change the intent of
  the test and the way it is read (#220).

## 0.2.1

### Other

- Important performance improvement when using `--fix`, in particular in projects with many R files (#217).

## 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

- For consistency between CLI arguments and `jarl.toml` arguments, the following CLI arguments are renamed (#199):
  - `--select-rules` becomes `--select`
  - `--ignore-rules` becomes `--ignore`
  - `--assignment-op` becomes `--assignment`

### Features

- New argument `extend-select` in `jarl.toml` and `--extend-select` in the CLI to select additional rules on top of the existing selection. This can be useful to select opt-in rules in addition to the default set of rules (#193).
- Added support for `seq` and `seq2` rules (#187).
- Added support for several rules related to `testthat`. Those rules are disabled by default and can be enabled by combining `select` or `extend-select` with the rule name or the `TESTTHAT` group rule name. Those rules are:
  - `expect_length` (#211)
  - `expect_named` (#212)
  - `expect_not` (#204)
  - `expect_null` (#202)
  - `expect_true_false` (#191)

### Fixes

- `implicit_assignment` no longer reports cases inside `quote()` (#209).

### Documentation

- Added section on Neovim to the [Editors](https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/editors) page (#188, @bjyberg).
- Added page "Tutorial: add a new rule" (#183).

## 0.1.2

### Features

- Added support for `list2df` rule (#179).
- Added support for `browser` rule (#185, @jonocarroll).
- Added support for `system_file` rule (#186).

### Fixes

- (Hopefully) Fixed wrong printing of ANSI characters in multiple terminals on Windows (#179, thanks @novica for the report).

### Documentation

- Added sections on RStudio and Helix to the [Editors](https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/editors) page.
- Added installation instructions using Scoop on Windows.

## 0.1.1

### Fixes

- Fix discovery of `jarl.toml` by the Jarl extension (#175, thanks @DavisVaughan for the report).
- Rule `duplicated_argument` no longer reports `cli_` functions where multiple arguments have the same name (#176, thanks @DavisVaughan for the report).

### Documentation

- The docs of `assignment` rule now explain how to change the preferred assignment operator.

## 0.1.0
