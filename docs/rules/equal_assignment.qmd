# `equal_assignment`
## What it does

Checks for usage of `=` as assignment operator.

## Why is this bad?

This is not "bad" strictly speaking since in most cases using `=` and `<-`
is equivalent. Some very popular packages use `=` without problems.

Nonetheless, `<-` is more popular and this rule may be useful to avoid
mixing both operators in a codebase.

## Example

```{r}
x = "a"
```

Use instead:
```{r}
x <- "a"
```
