# `class_equals`
## What it does

Checks for usage of `class(...) == "some_class"` and
`class(...) %in% "some_class"`.

## Why is this bad?

An R object can have several classes. Therefore,
`class(...) == "some_class"` would return a logical vector with as many
values as the object has classes, which is rarely desirable.

It is better to use `inherits(..., "some_class")` instead. `inherits()`
checks whether any of the object's classes match the desired class.

The same rationale applies to `class(...) %in% "some_class"`.

## Example

```{r}
x <- lm(drat ~ mpg, mtcars)
class(x) <- c("my_class", class(x))

class(x) == "lm"
```

Use instead:
```{r}
x <- lm(drat ~ mpg, mtcars)
class(x) <- c("my_class", class(x))

inherits(x, "lm")
```
