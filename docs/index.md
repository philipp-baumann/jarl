Jarl is a fast linter[^linter-explanation] for R.

* orders of magnitudes faster than `lintr` and `flir`[^benchmark]
* automatic fixes when possible
* support for 20+ [`lintr` rules](https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/rules) (and growing)
* integration in popular IDEs and editors (VS Code, Positron, Emacs, Vim, ...)
* CLI available
* multiple output modes available (concise, detailed, JSON format)
* built-in CI workflow

Jarl is built on [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/), a fast formatter for R written in Rust.

<br>

[^linter-explanation]: A code linter is a tool that does static code analysis to search for programming errors, bugs, and suspicious patterns of code.
[^benchmark]: Using 20 rules on the `dplyr` package (~25k lines of R code), Jarl took 0.131s, `flir` took 4.5s, and `lintr` took 18.5s (9s with caching enabled).

## Installation

### Binaries

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c \
  "irm https://github.com/etiennebacher/jarl/releases/latest/download/jarl-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

### From source

Alternatively, if you have Rust installed, you can get the development version with:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/etiennebacher/jarl --profile=release
```

## Acknowledgements

* [`lintr` authors and contributors](https://lintr.r-lib.org/authors.html): while the infrastructure is completely different, all the rule definitions and a large part of the tests are inspired or taken from `lintr`.
* Davis Vaughan and Lionel Henry, both for their work on Air and for their advices and answers to my questions during the development of Jarl.
* R Consortium for funding part of the development of Jarl.
* the design of Jarl is heavily inspired by [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) and [Cargo clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/).
